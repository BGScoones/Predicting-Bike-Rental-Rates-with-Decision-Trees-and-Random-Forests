# Predicting-Bike-Rental-Rates-with-Linear-Regression

In this project, I'll be predicting how many bikes were rented in a given hour with a linear regression model, a decision tree, and a random forest. Both models are modified to try and improve predictions, and the decision tree model and random forest were also modified in order to reduce the level of overfitting that occurred to the training dataset. The random forest was the most accurate model.
